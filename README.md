1. Project Description

     This project demonstrates the use of SQL to analyze and optimize supply chain operations. By simulating real-world data for suppliers, products, inventory, and orders, this project mirrors actual supply chain challenges businesses face. It provides insights into supplier performance, inventory management, and order tracking, offering a practical demonstration of how data-driven solutions can address these issues effectively. The project showcases advanced SQL techniques, including joins, grouping, and aggregate functions, to solve supply chain-related business challenges effectively.

3. SQL Queries and Insights

Query 1: Supplier Performance

Purpose: Identify the top-rated suppliers.

```sql
SELECT Name, Region, Rating
FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY Rating DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

Insight: Helps prioritize partnerships with top-rated suppliers.

Query 2: Inventory Status

Purpose: Identify products with stock levels below the reorder threshold.

```sql
SELECT p.Name AS ProductName, i.StockLevel, i.ReorderLevel, i.WarehouseLocation
FROM Inventory i
JOIN Products p ON i.ProductID = p.ProductID
WHERE i.StockLevel < i.ReorderLevel;
```

Insight: Flags itms for restocking to avoid stockouts.

Query 3: Order Details

Purpose: Summarize total cost and quantity ordered by product.

```sql
SELECT p.Name as ProductName, SUM(o.Quantity) AS TotalQuantity, SUM(o.TotalCost) AS TotalCost
FROM Orders o
JOIN Product p ON o.ProductID = p.ProductID
GROUP BY p.Name
ORDER BY TotalCost DESC;
```

Insight: Identifies top selling products and their total revenue.

Query 4: Pending Deliveries

Purpose: Identify orders with undelivered items.

```sql
SELECT o.OrderID, s.Name AS SupplierName, p.Name AS ProductName, o.OrderDate, o.Quantity
FROM Orders o
JOIN Suppliers s ON o.SupplierID = s.SupplierID
JOIN Product p ON o.ProductID = p.ProductID
WHERE o.DeliveryDate IS NULL;
```

Insight: Flags pending deliveries for follow-up

Query 5: Supplier Contribution

Purpose: Calculate total revenue generated by each supplier

```sql
SELECT s.Name AS SupplierName, SUM(o.TotlCost) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Orders o
JOIN Suppliers s ON o.SupplierID = s.SupplierID
GROUP BY s.Name
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC;
```

Insight: Evaluates the financial impact of each supplier

Table Creation

```sql
CREATE TABLE Suppliers (
     SupplierID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
     Name TEXT NOT NULL,
     Region TEXT NOT NULL,
     ContactNumver TEXT,
     Rating REAL
